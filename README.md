#### [Money Management](https://enesbehlul.github.io/Advanced_Programming/Project/index.html)


- In this application, users are intended to follow their expenses easily. Javascript, CSS and HTML are used.

- Each user has an account and the users perform their income and expense transactions on this account. Expenses and incomes are calculated among themselves and displayed on the screen.

- On a pie chart, Canvas shows every single expense's percentage according to total expence.

- The total cost of expense is shown as percentage according to total income.

- When spending or adding income, the user has to enter a description, a category information and a value of amount of money. All this information is shown separately as a list of incomes and expenses. The user can delete these list elements.

- User, Account and Action classes are used. Each Account class object has an Action Map type array that holds actions.
